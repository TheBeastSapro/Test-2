### Observation 1: Workspace-folder guidance misses whole-container-ephemeral platforms

**Status:** OPEN
**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Session context:** Installing task-observer into a repo running on Claude Code on the web (remote execution environment). Each session runs in a fresh, ephemeral container that is reclaimed after inactivity, and the repo is cloned fresh each time.
**Skill:** task-observer
**Type:** open-source
**Phase/Area:** references/environments.md — workspace folder resolution

**Issue:** The workspace-folder guidance (SKILL.md and references/environments.md) names ephemeral checkouts — a git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, a temporary clone — as the failure mode to detect and re-anchor away from. It doesn't name a distinct failure mode: platforms where the *entire session container* is ephemeral per session, not just a checkout subdirectory within an otherwise-persistent environment. On such platforms even the "stable" path (`~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/`) doesn't outlive a session, so the default guidance would silently write a log that vanishes at container teardown. This had to be caught manually and worked around with a CLAUDE.md override pinning the workspace folder to the git repo root and committing the observation files so persistence rides on git instead of the local filesystem.

**Suggested improvement:** Add a named pattern to references/environments.md for "whole-container-ephemeral" platforms (e.g. cloud/web coding environments that clone fresh per session), distinct from the worktree/temp-clone case already covered. Recommend anchoring the workspace folder inside the git repository itself and committing `skill-observations/` so persistence is git-backed rather than filesystem-backed, and suggest checking for this pattern during the Session Start Protocol's config-detection step.

**Principle:** Any skill instruction that assumes a persistent local filesystem needs an explicit fallback for platforms where the whole session container is ephemeral, not only for ephemeral subdirectories within an otherwise-persistent environment.
